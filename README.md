# Hey, I'm Max

I've been a Quantitative Trading Intern at Thinkmarkets and I am a cofounder and software engineer at [Preet](https://preetus.com) (B2B SaaS) and a core builder at [College DAO](https://collegedao.io) (web3 community). Preet has received seed funding from [UpHonest Capital](https://www.uphonestcapital.com/). I am also a VP of [Michigan Venture Club](mvcumich.com) at UMich managing the tech and entrepreneurship teams. I'm always open to meeting people working on interesting products and projects.
